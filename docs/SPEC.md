# Requirements to complete this project

## Description
In the simplest use case, `grep` searches a specified file for a specified string.
To do so, `grep` takes as its arguments a file path and a string.
Then it reads the file, finds lines in that file that contain the string argument, and prints those lines.

## Feature list
1. Takes 2 arguments: a file path and a query string
2. Search for all lines in the file containing the query string
3. Display those lines
